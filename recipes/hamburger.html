    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A hamburger, or simply a burger, is a dish consisting of fillings—usually
        a patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll.
        The patties are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon,
        or chilis with condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, relish or a
        "special sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island dressing, and are frequently
        placed on sesame seed buns. A hamburger patty topped with cheese is called a cheeseburger.
        Under some definitions, and in some cultures, a burger is considered a sandwich. </p>
