    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In 2001, Regina Schrambling went on a week long odyssey in search of the best lasagna recipe. Her ideal here has
        an intensely flavored sauce, cheeses melted into creaminess as if they were bechamel, meat thatâ€™s just chunky
        enough and noodles that put up no resistance to the fork.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground Beef</li>
        <li>Pasta Sheets</li>
        <li>Cheeses</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Ricotta</li>
            <li>Mozzarella</li>
            <li>Pecorino Romano</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Pasta Sauce</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the sirloin, cheese and eggs in a large bowl. Chop the parsley with the whole garlic until fine,
            then stir into the beef mixture. Season lavishly with salt and pepper. Using your hands, mix until all the
            ingredients are well blended. Shape into meatballs and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Dust the meatballs lightly with flour,
            shaking off excess, and lay into the hot oil. Brown the meatballs on all sides (do not cook through) and
            transfer to the sauce.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, combine the ricotta, eggs, Pecorino Romano, parsley and all
            but 1 cup of the mozzarella. Season well with salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Remove the meatballs and sausage from the sauce, and set aside to cool slightly, then chop coarsely. Spoon a
            thick layer of sauce into the bottom of a 9-by-12-inch lasagna pan. Cover with a layer of noodles. Spoon
            more sauce on top, then add a third of the meat and a third of the cheese mixture. Repeat for 2 more layers,
            using all the meat and cheese. Top with a layer of noodles, and cover with the remaining sauce. Sprinkle
            reserved mozzarella evenly over the top. Bake 30 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
